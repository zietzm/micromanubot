1 sentence that introduces a big and important problem/field---one that pretty
much everyone would agree is significant. Otherwise, why should the reader
care?. 1-2 sentences that focus on a significant challenge that is impeding
progress. What is the specific roadblock or barrier keeping the field from
moving forward that you plan to address in your study? Don't get into how you
address it, just present the more specific challenge. 1-2 sentences on the
opportunity. Here is where you introduce a recent advancement that changes how
we can address this problem. It could be that new computing power exists that
makes certain algorithms possible now, or that a new data resources has been
made available that changes how we can look at a problem. 1-2 sentences on what
your study is about. What did you do? How did you take advantage of this new
opportunity to address the challenge or roadblock you identified? 2-3 sentences
of your key results. What did you find? These should be results that support the
conclusions (declaration) in your title. 1 sentence on how the world will change
as a result of your findings. What will change about how medicine is practiced
or research is conducted because of what you found? What are the broader
impacts?  Adapted from Nick Tatonetti (https://tatonettilab.org/abstract)
